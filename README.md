I was working on a to-do list project where I built a task tracker using Flask for the backend and SQLAlchemy to manage the database. I created HTML templates for the front-end,
allowing users to add, display, and manage tasks. I also worked on improving the projectâ€™s styling with CSS, and along the way, I encountered issues with Git and Heroku while trying to deploy it.
